Types of databases
==================
RDBMS-MySQL,Oracle
----------------------
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
1.RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, 
IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is a type of database management system that stores data in a tabular form with a predefined schema.
2.RDBMS databases are best suited for applications that require complex queries and transactions.
3.It follows ACID property
Ex: Oracle





NON-RDBMS-MongoDB,Cassandra
-----------------------------
1.Non-RDBMS, or NoSQL databases, use a flexible schema and store data in a non-tabular format. 
2.NoSQL databases are better suited for applications with large amounts of unstructured data.
3.Follows CAP Property
