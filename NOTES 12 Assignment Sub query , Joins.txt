1. WAQ to find count of first_names from Employees

select count( first_name) from Employees;

2. WAQ to fetch the first 50% record from a table Employees

SELECT *
FROM EMployees
WHERE employee_id<=(SELECT count(*)/2 FROM Employees)

3.WAQ to fetch the last record from the table Employees

SELECT *
FROM EMployees
WHERE employee_id=(SELECT max(employee_id) FROM Employees)


4. WAQ to display the dept_id,first_name and the job_id for all the employees who work in 
IT_PROG

select department_id,first_name , job_id from employees where job_id ='IT_PROG';


5. WAQ to display first_name,salary,dept_no for those employees who earn such amount of  salary which is the smallest salary of all the department.

select first_name,salary,department_id from employees where salary = (select  min(salary) from employees);


6. You have two tables in an Oracle database: `employees` and `departments`. The `employees` table contains the following columns: `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `hire_date`, `salary`, and `department_id`. The `departments` table contains the following columns: `department_id`, `department_name`, and `location`.

Write a SQL query that returns the department name and the average salary of employees in that department.

SELECT department_name,avg(salary) as "AVG_SALARY" FROM employees E full join
departments D on  e.department_id = d.department_id group by department_name 

select job_id , (salary/30) from employees;

select avg(salary),job_id from employees group by job_id;

Use a subquery to calculate the average salary for each department.
Sort the results by average salary in descending order.
Here's an example of the expected output:

select job_id  as  "department_name", avg(salary) as "AVG_SALARY" from employees group by job_id order by  AVG_SALARY DESC; //(WORKING)

SELECT department_name,avg(salary) as "AVG_SALARY" FROM employees E full join
departments D on  e.department_id = d.department_id group by department_name order by  AVG_SALARY DESC; //(WORKING)


department_name  avg_salary
---------------  ----------
Sales            75000
Marketing        60000
Accounting       55000


7. You have two tables in an Oracle database: `orders` and `customers`. The `orders` table contains the following columns: `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `total_amount`. The `customers` table contains the following columns: `customer_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `phone`.

Write a SQL query that returns a list of all orders along with the first name, last name, and email of the customer who placed the order.

SELECT first name, last name,  email FROM orders O  FULL JOIN customers C ON O.customer_id = C.customer_id where order_id  not null ;

Sort the results by order date in descending order.

SELECT first name, last name,  email FROM orders O  FULL JOIN customers C ON O.customer_id = C.customer_id where order_id  not null  order by order_date ;




Use an INNER JOIN to join the two tables.

SELECT * FROM orders O  INNER JOIN customers C ON O.customer_id = C.customer_id;

Here's an example of the expected output:


order_id  customer_id  order_date             total_amount  first_name  last_name   email
--------  -----------  -------------------  ------------  ----------  ----------  --------------------

2         1002         2021-01-02 00:00:00   200.00        Jane        Smith       jane.smith@example.com

8.Retrieve the names of all employees who work in the same department as the employee named John Smith.

 SELECT concat(first_name, last_name),department_name FROM employees E full join
departments D on  e.department_id = d.department_id order  by department_name;



9. Retrieve the names of all departments that have more than 10 employees.

select department_name from employees E full join
departments D on  e.department_id = d.department_id group by department_name having count(employee_id) >10;

10.Retrieve the names of all employees who earn more than rs50,000 per year

select first_name , last_name from employees where (salary* 12 )> '50000';

11.Retrieve the names of all employees who work in the department named 'Sales'

select first_name , last_name from employees E full join
departments D on  e.department_id = d.department_id where department_name = 'Sales';



12.Retrieve the names of all employees who have a manager with the last name 'King'

select first_name , last_name from employees where Department_id =(select department_id from employees where last_name ='King') and last_name != 'King';
