CLASS NOTES

Concatenation operator
----------------------
|| operator is used to combine column names with any string or values.


What is an Alias in SQL?
An alias is a feature of SQL that is supported by most, if not all, RDBMSs. It is a temporary name assigned to the table or table column for the purpose of a particular SQL query. In addition, aliasing can be employed as an obfuscation technique to secure the real names of database fields. A table alias is also called a correlation name.

An alias is represented explicitly by the AS keyword but in some cases, the same can be performed without it as well. Nevertheless, using the AS keyword is always a good practice.



Between AND operator/ Not Between AND operator
=================================================
It is used to select a value which lies between the given range.
[value between lowerlimit and upperlimit].

Syntax
--------
SELECT ColumnName
FROM tableName
WHERE ColumnName BETWEEN lowerlimit AND higherlimit;


Relational operators in SQL
===============================
< - less than
> - greater than
<= - less than or equal 
>= - greater than or equal
!= - not equal
other symbols used are
(not equal)[<>,^=]
