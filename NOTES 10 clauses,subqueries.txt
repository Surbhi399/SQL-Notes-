Clauses in SQL(Oracle)
=====================
1.The SELECT Clause/Statement
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

2.The  WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
NOTE:The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.

3.The ORDER BY clause
ORDER BY  is used to sort the set in ascending or descending order.
ORDER BY  sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

4.The GROUP BY 
The GROUP BY  is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the set by one or more columns.
syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);

5.The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE clause cannot be used with aggregate functions.
syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);



Subqueries
------------
1. What is a subquery in Oracle?
1. A subquery in Oracle is a query within a query. It is a SELECT statement that is embedded within another SELECT statement.

2. What are the types of subqueries in Oracle?
2. There are two types of subqueries in Oracle: single-row subqueries and multiple-row subqueries. A single-row subquery returns only one row, while a multiple-row subquery returns multiple rows.

3. How do you write a subquery in Oracle?

4. What is the syntax for a subquery in Oracle?
The syntax for a subquery in Oracle is:


SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE column_name operator (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);

5. What is the maximum number of subqueries that can be nested in Oracle?
 The maximum number of subqueries that can be nested in Oracle is 255.

6. What is the difference between a subquery and a join in Oracle?
The main difference between a subquery and a join in Oracle is that a subquery is a query within a query, while a join combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

7. How do you use a subquery in a WHERE clause in Oracle?

8. How do you use a subquery in a SELECT clause in Oracle?

FROM table1
WHERE condition;
